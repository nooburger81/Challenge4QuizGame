# Challenge4QuizGame
Enter the Quiz Game. Leave victorious. 

## Description

One user enters the quiz game show, and only one comes out. Behold! A Victor!

## Usage

The rules are simple, press the button on the screen and then press at least 4 more buttons to complete the exercise. Bask in the underwhelmingness of it all. (i plan to come back and finish this, I just got distracted and needed to get it out of my head....)

I'm not sure how to reference this, but I usually watch about a dozen or so YouTube vidoes and read dozens of pages of reference material, then use it, along with my notes, to check my work and eventually solve the problem.
